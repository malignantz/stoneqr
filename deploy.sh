# Deploy StoneQR to Cloudflare Pages as static assets.
# Builds apps/site with adapter-static, then uploads ./apps/site/build.
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy.sh              # build and deploy to production
#   ./deploy.sh --dry-run    # build and list the output, no upload
#
# Requires: bun, wrangler (npx wrangler), already authenticated (`npx wrangler whoami`).
# First time: `npx wrangler pages project create stoneqr --production-branch main`,
# then add the custom domain stoneqr.app in the Cloudflare dashboard.

# Pages can serve the new index.html before every hashed asset is reachable from every edge. In
# that window a request for a missing asset gets the not-found page, and the _headers rule for
# /_app/immutable/* stamps it with a one-year immutable cache header, so the edge and the first
# browser to ask keep a broken page (seen 2026-09-04). Poll with a throwaway query string, which
# has its own cache key, so the checks can never poison the canonical one; once every asset is
# right, fetch the canonical URLs once to warm them with the real files.
