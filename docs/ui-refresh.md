# UI refresh: cleaner, calmer, more obvious

Status: planned 2026-09-04, built 2026-09-04 (phases 0 to 5), second pass the same day (§8c). Milestone M10 in `plan.md`. What is left is on real hardware, not in the code: see §10. This is the design
contract for the refresh; the rules in `CLAUDE.md` (Basic/Advanced split, `advancedInUse`, the
hero row, "Photo QR" naming, the bundle budget, the decode check) all stay in force.

The site already has a good voice: warm paper, ink, one verdigris accent, mono "ticket" labels,
Fraunces headings, the cutting-mat grid. Nothing here replaces that. The problem is that the
panels underneath the voice were built control by control, so the generator reads as a stack of
form fields rather than a designed tool. The fix is a small set of shared primitives, then
rebuilding each panel out of them, starting with the Advanced Style section.

---

## 1. What is wrong today

Audited on the dev build at 1440 px and 375 px, Basic and Advanced.

### Style panel (Advanced) — the weakest surface

- **Shape pickers are words in boxes.** "Square, Rounded, Dots, Classy, Soft" and "Square,
  Rounded, Round, Classy" give no idea what they draw, and "Round" next to "Rounded" is a
  guessing game. Nothing on the site shows what a corner frame or a corner dot even is.
- **Segmented controls wrap badly** in the 22 rem column: "Soft" orphans onto its own row under
  Modules; Corner frames and Corner dots sit in half-width columns and break into three rows
  each with a lone "Round" at the bottom.
- **No hierarchy.** Colours, transparency, contrast readout, modules, corners, gradient, logo, and
  frame are eight blocks of identical weight in one column. The eye has nowhere to start.
- **Browser chrome leaks through.** The logo picker is the native "Choose File · No file chosen"
  control, the colour wells are native, the range sliders are native. Each one is in a different
  visual language from the paper-and-ink chrome around it.
- **Loose readouts.** "Contrast 21.0:1" floats under the Transparent checkbox with no relation to
  the colour fields it describes. The frame toggle's label needs four `!important` overrides to
  look like body text.
- **Nothing is previewed.** You cannot see a gradient, a corner style, or a frame until it has
  rendered in the big preview, and with a picture blended in the whole panel greys out with no
  memory of what was set.

### The rest of the generator

- **`<details>` accordions with a text "▶"** as the chevron; the collapsed heading tells you
  nothing about what is inside or whether anything is set (a logo, a frame, a picture).
- **Content type picker** is ten chips wrapping 4 / 4 / 2. Works, but reads as tags, not a choice.
- **Size and download (Advanced)** is one long column: width, unit, five preset chips, read-from,
  the notice, error correction, quiet zone / min version / mask, dpi, then a 2 × 2 grid of buttons
  in four different button styles (accent, ink, secondary, secondary), then two small buttons.
  The grouping is there in the code but not on the page.
- **Sliders** (logo size, margin, gradient angle, six in Photo QR) are unstyled and their label /
  slider / value columns do not align between rows.
- **Phones.** The preview card comes first, so a new visitor sees an empty card that says "type
  something in the content panel" before they see the content panel. The plan calls for a sticky
  preview on mobile; it is not sticky. The nav wraps to two lines and the hero fills most of the
  first screen before the tool appears.
- **The toggle** is labelled "CONTROLS Basic | Advanced" in a ticket, which is accurate but reads
  as a settings label rather than an invitation.

### Other pages

- `/print-size`, `/bulk`, `/compare`, `/never-expires` share the eyebrow + h1 + lede opening and
  the `.sheet` cards, which is right. `/bulk` is the densest page on the site and will benefit
  from the same section primitives as the generator; the others need only the global polish.
- The footer and header are fine on desktop. On phones the header needs a plan for seven links.

---

## 2. Design principles for the refresh

1. **One vocabulary.** Every panel is built from the same five parts: a section header, a field
   row, a swatch grid, a slider row, and a drop tile. If a control needs a sixth, the sixth is
   added to `app.css` and used everywhere, never styled inline.
2. **Show, don't name.** Any choice that changes how the code looks is picked from a drawn
   swatch, not a word. Words are captions under the swatch, in ticket type.
3. **Group by question, order by frequency.** Style is four questions: what colours, what shape,
   is there a logo, is there a frame. Size and download is three: how big, how encoded, which
   file. Each group gets a ticket header and a hairline; the most-used group comes first.
4. **Readouts sit with what they measure.** The contrast ratio belongs beside the colour pair,
   the logo percentage beside the logo slider, the module size beside the width.
5. **The collapsed state carries a summary.** A closed Style panel says "Rounded · Logo · Frame",
   a closed Photo QR panel says "WiFi shape · Silhouette", so nothing is hidden by folding.
6. **Native controls wear our clothes.** Colour wells, file inputs, and range sliders stay native
   for accessibility and keyboard behaviour, and are restyled or wrapped so they look like part
   of the sheet.
7. **Calm motion.** 120 ms colour and border transitions, the existing first-load reveal, nothing
   that moves layout. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` as now.
8. **No new dependencies, no new chunks.** Swatch previews are inline SVG, at most a few hundred
   bytes each. The generator page stays well inside the 150 KB budget (85 KB today).

---

## 3. Primitives to add (Phase 0)

All in `apps/site/src/app.css` under `@layer components`, plus five small Svelte components in
`apps/site/src/lib/components/`. Each component is dumb: props in, events out, no `Design` import,
so the bulk page and the print-size page can use them too.

| Primitive | Where | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `SectionHeader.svelte` | components | h2 or h3 in Fraunces, optional badge slot on the right, optional one-line summary in ticket type shown only when the section is collapsed, a real chevron icon. Replaces every `<details><summary>` and the plain `<h2 class="text-xl">` headings. |
| `.subhead` | app.css | A ticket label with a hairline rule after it: `COLOURS ————`. The grouping device inside a panel. |
| `.row` | app.css | Grid `[label] [control] [readout]` at `auto 1fr auto`, readout in `.num`, so slider rows and short field rows align down the whole column. |
| `Slider.svelte` | components | Native `<input type=range>` in a `.row`, with the track and thumb restyled (ink thumb, rule track, accent fill via `background-size` trick), label, unit, and an optional reset-to-default dot that appears when the value is not the default. |
| `ColourField.svelte` | components | A 36 px swatch button beside a mono hex input, with a "disabled" style for the Paper field when transparent is on. The swatch opens our own `ColourPopover` (below); the native `<input type=color>` is gone from the site. |
| `ColourPopover.svelte` | components | The in-page colour picker: a modal `<dialog>` anchored to the swatch, closed by a click anywhere outside, with that click swallowed. Detailed in section 3a. |
| `Swatches.svelte` | components | A fixed-column grid of square tiles (`grid-cols-5` at 22 rem), each tile holding an inline SVG drawn from a snippet, caption beneath in ticket type, `aria-pressed`, ink border when selected. Never wraps a tile onto a lonely row because the column count is fixed per group. |
| `DropTile.svelte` | components | A dashed tile, "Drop a picture here or choose a file", PNG / JPEG / WebP note, native file input inside for keyboard and click, drag-over state in accent. When a file is set it becomes a thumbnail row with the name and a Remove link. Used for the logo and for Photo QR. |
| `.toggle` | app.css | A checkbox styled as a small switch for on/off decisions that reveal more controls (frame, transparent background, blend the picture). Plain checkboxes stay for flags inside forms (hidden network, all day). |
| Icons | `lib/icons.ts` | About fourteen 16 px stroke icons as string constants: chevron, tick, warning, upload, remove, and one per content type. Inline SVG, no sprite, no library. |

Also in Phase 0: restyle the native file input and range input globally so any place the
components are not used yet still looks intentional, and replace the text "▶" everywhere.

### 3a. The colour picker

The native colour input opens an operating-system window: it floats away from the swatch, it
stays open while you click elsewhere, and on macOS it is the full Colors panel with its own tabs.
Every colour on the site (Ink, Paper, Fill "to", Frame, Frame text, and Ink and Paper on `/bulk`)
goes through `ColourField`, so replacing the native input in one component fixes all of them.

**Behaviour, in order of importance.**

1. Clicking a swatch opens a small card (about 232 px wide) directly under the swatch, left
   edge aligned, flipped above or shifted inward when it would leave the viewport.
2. Clicking or tapping anywhere outside the card closes it, and that click does nothing else:
   it does not press a button, focus a field, or select a module shape underneath.
3. Escape closes it. Focus goes back to the swatch.
4. Changes apply live while dragging, so the preview updates as you move; the preview's
   existing 60 ms style debounce absorbs the drag.
5. Scrolling or resizing the page closes it, so the card never drifts away from its swatch.

**How the click-away swallows the click.** The card is a `<dialog>` opened with `showModal()`.
The browser puts a modal dialog in the top layer and marks everything else on the page inert, so
a pointer event outside the card lands on the dialog's `::backdrop`, never on the page. The
component listens for `pointerdown` on the dialog element itself (the backdrop is part of the
dialog for hit-testing; a `pointerdown` whose target is the dialog and not a child is a backdrop
press) and calls `close()`. The backdrop is fully transparent, so the page looks unchanged while
the card is open, but it is untouchable. This is the only approach that swallows the click for
free: the Popover API's light dismiss and a `document` click listener both let the outside click
through to whatever is under it, which is exactly the complaint.

**Anatomy of the card.**

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ ┌──────────────────────────┐ │   saturation / value square, 200 × 140,
│ │            ●             │ │   pointer drag, arrow keys move 1 %, shift 10 %
│ └──────────────────────────┘ │
│ ━━━━━━━━●━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ │   hue strip: a native range, restyled, 0–360
│ [#1F6F63]      ◉ Eyedropper  │   mono hex field (live, validated), EyeDropper
│ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■ ■              │   swatches: ink, paper, accent, black, white,
└──────────────────────────────┘   plus the other colours currently in the design
```

- The square and hue strip work in HSV; conversion to and from hex is about 30 lines in
  `lib/colour.ts` with unit tests (round trip every swatch, the six site tokens, and the edge
  cases `#000`, `#fff`, and pure hues).
- The hex field accepts 3 or 6 digits with or without `#`, normalises on blur, and shows the
  block colour on an invalid value without changing the design.
- The eyedropper button appears only where `window.EyeDropper` exists (Chrome and Edge; Safari
  and Firefox hide it). It lets someone match a brand colour from a logo on screen.
- The swatch row always includes the site's ink, paper, and accent, black and white, and
  whichever of Ink, Paper, Fill "to", Frame, and Frame text are set in the current design, so
  matching the frame to the ink is one click.
- Keyboard: Tab order is square, hue, hex, eyedropper, swatches. The square is a `role=slider`
  pair (aria-valuetext "saturation 40 %, brightness 70 %"). The dialog traps focus by nature.
- Touch: the same card, anchored the same way, with a 44 px hit area on the square's handle. On
  screens under 480 px it is centred horizontally instead of aligned to the swatch, because a
  swatch at the column's right edge would push the card off screen.

**Sizing and dependencies.** About 180 lines of Svelte and 30 of TypeScript, no library, no lazy
chunk, roughly 2 KB gzipped, in the core generator bundle. Every browser the site supports has
had modal `<dialog>` since 2022 (Safari 15.4, Firefox 98, Chrome 37).

**Acceptance.** With the card open, clicking a module swatch, the Basic/Advanced toggle, a
download button, or a text field does nothing except close the card; a second click then acts
normally. Escape closes it and returns focus to the swatch. Dragging in the square updates the
preview live and the decode badge still settles to "Scannable". The card never renders partly
off screen at 375 px or 1440 px. Contrast readouts and the frame colours behave as before.

**Where it lands.** Phase 0, since `ColourField` is a primitive; it is exercised by Phase 1 on
the five Style colours and by Phase 5 on `/bulk`.

---

### 3b. What Phase 0 settled

Built 2026-09-04. Two things came out differently from the sketch above, both measured rather
than guessed:

- **The left column stays at 22 rem.** The plan expected to widen it to 24 rem for five tiles.
  Measured at 1440 px, the five module tiles land at 59 px each on one row inside the existing
  column, and the four corner tiles at 73 px, so the column was left alone and the preview keeps
  its width.
- **`<details>` is gone from the generator.** `SectionHeader` owns a plain boolean instead, which
  removes the whole class of bug the two panels carried a comment about: Svelte merges a block's
  dynamic attributes into one effect, so `details.open = open` was reasserted whenever a sibling
  attribute changed, and ticking "Transparent background" slammed the Style panel shut.

Cost: the generator page's eagerly loaded client JavaScript went from 85.4 KB to 91.4 KB gzipped,
against the 150 KB budget. Photo QR took the new header in the same pass so the site has one
chevron; the rest of that panel is still Phase 4.

## 4. Phase 1: Style panel

The reason this refresh exists. Basic and Advanced share the same layout; Basic simply shows
fewer groups.

```
Style                                   Rounded · Logo · Frame   ⌄

    [ Scan for menu                ]   chips: Scan me · Scan to RSVP …
    [■] Frame   [■] Text
```

Specifics:

- **Group order** is Colours, Shape, Logo, Frame in both sets. Basic hides Fill, Corners, and
  Transparent; those keep reporting through `Design.advancedInUse` exactly as now.
- **Colours** become two `ColourField`s on one row. The contrast reading moves into the subhead's
  right slot as a badge: `21:1 · print safe` in ok green, `3.2:1 · too low` in warn. It uses the
  existing `.badge` classes so it matches the Size panel's badge. Transparent is a `.toggle` on
  the same row in Advanced.
- **Fill** (was "Gradient") is Solid / Linear / Radial. When not Solid, a second colour field
  labelled "to" and, for Linear, an angle slider appear on the next line. The hint about RGB
  printing stays.
- **Modules** is a `Swatches` group of five. Each tile draws a 3 × 3 patch of modules in that
  style (square rects, rounded rects, circles, the leaf shape, extra-rounded). The library's ids
  do not change; only the captions do: `classy` is captioned "Leaf", `extra-rounded` "Soft".
- **Corners** is one subhead with two swatch rows, Frame and Dot, each tile drawing a finder
  pattern (7 × 7) with that corner-frame or corner-dot style. Captions use one vocabulary across
  both rows: Square, Rounded, Circle, Leaf. No more "Round" beside "Rounded".
- **Logo** uses `DropTile`. Once a logo is set, the tile becomes the thumbnail row, then two
  `Slider`s (Size with the % area readout coloured by the warn and block ratios, Margin in
  modules) and the knockout toggle, reworded "Clear space behind the logo". The ECC-forced-to-H
  hint stays, one line.
- **Frame** is a `.toggle` labelled "Call to action under the code". On, it reveals the text
  input with the datalist, the six chips, and two `ColourField`s labelled Frame and Text. The
  `!important` label hack goes away because the toggle row is its own primitive.
- **While a picture is blended in**, the panel still greys out and the notice stays, but the
  collapsed summary keeps reporting what is set ("Off: photo · Rounded · Frame") so the user knows
  what comes back when the picture is removed.
- **Width.** The left column grows from 22 rem to 24 rem on `lg` and the right column shrinks to
  match, so five 40 px tiles with 8 px gaps fit with the panel padding. The preview column takes
  the remainder, as now.

Acceptance: at 1440 px no segmented control or swatch group wraps; every visual choice shows a
drawing; every readout sits on the row of the control it describes; `bun run check` and
`bun run test` pass unchanged (no renderer changes, so no golden updates); the styled and
halftone decode badges behave exactly as before.

---

## 5. Phase 2: Generator shell and Content panel

- **Section headers.** Content, Style, Photo QR, Size and download all use `SectionHeader`.
  Content is always open (no chevron). Style and Photo QR collapse with a summary. The
  `panelOpen` reasoning in the two panels (why the open state is held locally and never driven
  by the prop) moves into the component with its comment intact.
- **Content type** becomes a 5 × 2 grid of tiles, each with its 16 px icon over the label,
  selected tile in ink. Same `role=radiogroup` semantics. The description line under it stays.
- **The toggle** reads `Show  ( Basic | Advanced )` with the ticket "Show" rather than
  "Controls". The "Advanced settings still apply" notice stays but gains the chevron icon and the
  lighter `.notice-info` treatment.
- **Phones (below `lg`).** Order becomes Content, Preview, Style, Photo QR, Size and download.
  Once the full preview scrolls off screen, a compact bar pins to the bottom of the viewport: a
  56 px thumbnail of the current render, the decode badge, and the primary download button. It
  is one small component (`PreviewBar.svelte`) driven by an `IntersectionObserver` on the preview
  card and hidden at `lg` and above. This is the "sticky preview" the plan asked for, done in a
  way that does not steal the first screen.
- **Hero on phones.** The h1 clamp floor drops from 2.2 rem to 1.9 rem below `sm`, and the
  landing-page ledes are trimmed to one sentence on phones with a `hidden sm:inline` second
  sentence. The first-load reveal is unchanged.
- **Header on phones.** The nav becomes a single horizontally scrolling row with a fade at the
  right edge below `md`, so it never wraps. Desktop is unchanged. Labels stay as they are (they
  match the routes and the OG cards).
- **Preview card.** Keep the caption strip. Add a thin "actual size" toggle in the strip
  (Advanced only): when on, the preview renders at the chosen print width using CSS `mm` units
  with a 10 mm scale bar beneath, capped at the card width. It is honest about being approximate
  on high-density screens in its tooltip. Small feature, very on-brand, and it makes the size
  tiers in Basic tangible when Garrett tests on a phone held next to a printed sheet.

---

### 5b. What Phase 2 settled

Built 2026-09-04.

- **The left column is `display: contents` below `lg`.** Getting Content, Preview, Style, Photo
  QR, Size and download into that order on a phone meant the content sheet and the style sheet
  had to be separate grid items; making their wrapper `contents` on phones and `block` at `lg`
  does that without duplicating any markup. On desktop the left column is now two stacked cards
  rather than one long one, which separates what the code contains from what it looks like.
- **The pinned bar lives in ExportPanel, not beside the preview.** Its button has to be the real
  download, and the export path carries the worker, the progress readout, and the stale-chunk
  message; duplicating that for a second button would have been the wrong trade. The bar finds
  the preview card and the generator by id and watches both, so it appears once the preview
  scrolls away and hides again below the tool rather than sitting over the footer. The rendered
  Photo QR object URL moved onto `Design.halftonePreviewUrl` so the bar can show the same
  thumbnail; Preview still owns creating and revoking it.
- **Actual size is measured, not asserted.** At a 50 mm setting the preview host comes out 189 px
  wide and the scale bar 38 px, which is exactly 50 mm and 10 mm at the 96 px per inch browsers
  assume. The toggle's tooltip says so rather than implying the screen is calibrated.
- **A whitespace trap.** Wrapping the second sentence of each hero in `hidden sm:inline` with the
  joining space *inside* the span renders "expire.Vector" — Svelte trims it. The space goes
  before the span.

Cost: the generator page's eager client JavaScript went from 91.4 KB to 92.6 KB gzipped, against
the 150 KB budget.

## 6. Phase 3: Size and download panel

Same structure as Style: subheads, rows, one primary action.

```
Size and download                                   ● print safe
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PRINT SIZE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Advanced: Width [ 50 ] [mm ⌄]   Read from [   ] m
          Sticker 20 · Card 30 · Flyer 50 · Poster 120 · Sign 250
          ▸ At 50 mm each module is 1.52 mm. Safe. Reads to about 0.5 m.

ENCODING (Advanced) ───────────────────────────────────────────────

```

- Basic keeps PNG as the primary button, Advanced keeps SVG, exactly as now; only the
  presentation changes. The four-style 2 × 2 grid becomes one primary and one uniform row.
- The dpi select moves out of the encoding grid and into the Files group as a small inline
  select on the text row, because it only affects the PNG.
- The sizing notices stay under Print size; the ECC hint sits on the ECC row's readout slot.
- The tier cards in Basic get the `.row` alignment for the name / size / distance so the four
  cards line up, and the "Custom" row keeps its behaviour.

---

### 6b. What Phase 3 settled

Built 2026-09-04. The panel became Print size, Encoding, Files, and the four-different-styles
button grid became one primary with a uniform row of three underneath, using a stacked button so
"PDF / CMYK" fits a 101 px cell. The dpi control moved into Files, where it belongs, since it
only changes the PNG.

Three layout bugs surfaced while measuring, all of them older than this phase:

- **The three columns started too early.** At a flat 22 rem the side columns left the preview
  about 208 px at 1024 px wide, which crushed the caption strip and broke the figures under the
  code across two lines. The side columns now hold back to 18 rem between `lg` and `xl`. Note
  that the site's root font size is 17 px, so 18 rem is 306 px and 22 rem is 374 px.
- **A section heading blew out its column.** `SectionHeader` is a grid item inside the panel's
  grid, so its automatic minimum was its min-content — "Size and download" plus a 7 rem status
  badge, about 312 px — which pushed the whole sheet past its 306 px track and the page into a
  horizontal scroll. The heading now carries `min-w-0` and wraps rather than truncates, so the
  badge drops to its own line instead of the title being ellipsised.
- **The caption strip ran out of room** once it held a label, the Actual size toggle, and the
  decode badge. The 10 mm scale bar moved into the preview area, beside the artwork where it
  reads better anyway, and the "Preview" label is screen-reader-only between `lg` and `xl`.

Cost: 92.6 KB to 92.7 KB gzipped, against the 150 KB budget.

## 7. Phase 4: Photo QR panel

- `DropTile` for the picture, with the seven shapes beneath it as a `Swatches` group (they are
  already tiles; they become the same tile as everywhere else).
- Crop: the three sliders become `Slider` rows so Zoom / Across / Down align, with the reset
  dot on each when moved. Later (not this refresh): a draggable crop box on a thumbnail.
- Look: Dot size, Fade, Contrast as `Slider` rows in Advanced; the tone as a three-tile
  `Swatches` group (a colour, a grey, and a black-and-white silhouette of the same tiny sample)
  in place of the segmented control, since the choice is visual. Cut stays a slider with Paper
  and Ink end labels; the percentage readout stays Advanced-only.
- The two explanatory paragraphs at the bottom become one, with the second sentence in the
  collapsed summary instead ("PNG or SVG").

---

## 8. Phase 5: The other pages and global polish

- `/bulk`: apply `SectionHeader`, `.subhead`, `.row`, and the restyled selects and file input;
  the three cards keep their order. The results table gets the `.prose table` treatment.
- `/print-size`: already close; adopt `Slider` for scan distance beside the number field, and the
  same result badge as the generator.
- `/compare`, `/never-expires`, `/open-source`, `/privacy`: no layout change. Global polish only.
- Global: consistent focus rings (`outline` in accent on every interactive element, not only
  segmented buttons); disabled states at 45 % opacity everywhere; `.notice` gains a 16 px icon
  slot; button heights unified at 40 px (`btn`) and 32 px (`btn-sm`); table rows in `/compare`
  get a hover tint; the footer's three columns collapse to two on `sm`.
- Print stylesheet: hide the toggle and the preview bar as well as the header and footer.

---

### 8b. What phases 4 and 5 settled

Built 2026-09-04.

- **Photo QR became sliders and tiles.** Crop and Look are `Slider` rows with reset dots, the
  tone is three drawn tiles of the same scene (`ToneArt`) rather than three words, and the seven
  built-in shapes wear the `.swatch` tile without captions — seven captions do not fit a 22 rem
  column, and the shapes say what they are. They stayed plain buttons rather than a `Swatches`
  group because loading a shape is an action, not a selection, and forcing radio semantics onto
  it would have been a lie.
- **A slider can have no readout.** Basic hides the Cut percentage, which left the reset dot
  announcing "Reset Cut to ". `Slider` now drops the value from its label when `format` returns
  nothing.
- **The bulk CSV picker became a drop tile**, which meant its handler had to take a `File` rather
  than a change event. Verified end to end: a synthesised CSV parses to "3 rows · 2 columns" and
  generates two codes.
- **Global polish went into `@layer base`**, so one focus ring and one disabled treatment cover
  every control, including the ones no component had thought about. Notices gained an icon
  column, `.prose-table` shares the prose table rules with the bulk preview, and control heights
  are 2.5 rem and 2 rem — 43 px and 34 px at this site's 17 px root, not the 40/32 the sketch
  assumed.
- **Two more lg-band clips**, found the same way as Phase 3's: the paired colour fields cut the
  last character off "#000000" at 306 px, and the longest swatch caption overran its tile by a
  pixel. The colour pair stacks in that band; the caption's letter-spacing came in.

Cost: 92.7 KB to 93.7 KB gzipped, against the 150 KB budget. Across all six phases: 85.4 KB to
93.7 KB, an 8.3 KB increase for the whole refresh.

## 8c. Second pass

Audited again on 2026-09-04 after the six phases had landed, at 1280 px and 375 px, Basic and
Advanced, plus the other pages. Nothing structural was wrong; what remained were seams between
the two control sets, a few places where browser defaults still showed, and keyboard gaps in the
controls that claim radio semantics.

- **One set of print sizes.** The Advanced chips were Sticker 20, Card 30, Flyer 50, Poster 120,
  Sign 250, while Basic listed 25, 50, 100, and 300. Choosing "Small" in Basic then switching
  highlighted nothing, and "Card 30 mm" in Advanced came back to Basic as "Custom". The chips now
  read from `SIZE_TIERS`, so a size chosen in either set is the chosen one in the other, and
  `sizes.ts` is the only place a width is written down.
- **Numbers stay in Advanced.** The Version / Modules / ECC / Module row under the preview, and
  the contrast ratio in the Colours badge, showed in both sets. Basic now keeps the badge's
  verdict ("clear" or "too low") and drops the figures; the size list already says what the
  module size means in words. The Photo QR closing note lost its version number in Basic too.
- **The promise line showed twice on a desktop**, under the preview and under the download
  buttons, a column apart. It is phone-only under the preview now, where it is the first
  reassurance after the code appears, and stays with the downloads everywhere.
- **The download sheet stretched** to the height of the Style column beside it, leaving a quarter
  of the card empty on a wide screen. It is `self-start` at `lg`.
- **Drawn choices take the arrow keys.** The type tiles and every `Swatches` group carried
  `role="radio"` without the behaviour that promises: every tile was a tab stop and the arrows
  did nothing. `radiogroup.ts` is a small action that moves focus and the choice with the arrow
  keys, Home, and End; the tiles carry a roving `tabindex`, so Tab lands on the chosen one.
- **Toggles announce as switches.** The five `.toggle` inputs carry `role="switch"`, so a screen
  reader says "on" and "off" rather than "checked".
- **Export failures are a notice, not an alert.** The stale-chunk explanation and any other
  export error now sit under the download buttons as a `.notice-block` with `role="alert"`,
  in the site's own type, instead of a native dialog.
- **The hand-off link is properly out of reach** when there is nothing to hand off: it was
  `aria-disabled` but still followed `#` to the top of the page. It now loses pointer events,
  its tab stop, and half its opacity.
- **A skip link.** The first Tab press on any page offers "Skip to content", ahead of the seven
  nav links, and `<main>` carries the id it points at.
- **Feet beside metres** in the Advanced "reads to about" hint, through the same `formatDistance`
  the Basic tiers use.
- **No Basic-to-Advanced flash on load.** The prerendered page is Basic, and a saved Advanced
  choice used to be applied in `onMount`, so every visit painted Basic and then rebuilt the
  panels. Now a one-line inline script in `app.html` stamps `data-mode="advanced"` on `<html>`
  before first paint, `app.css` keeps the tool and its toggle invisible (space kept) until the
  Generator sets `data-hydrated`, and the Generator reads the saved mode synchronously so its
  first client render is Advanced. Svelte 5 recovers from an `{#if}` that differs from the
  server by rendering that branch afresh, without a warning. The script's sha256 is in the CSP
  in `svelte.config.js`; the same script lifts the hold after three seconds regardless, so a
  failed or slow hydration shows the Basic tool rather than nothing. (A CSS animation was tried
  first for that release and dropped: a hidden tab never advances it.) Basic visitors see no
  change at all.
- **Found while verifying the above on the live site:** Cloudflare Pages had no `404.html`, so a
  request for a hashed asset that had not yet replicated after a deploy came back as
  `index.html` with a 200, our `_headers` rule stamped it with a one-year immutable cache
  header, and the edge and the first browser to ask kept a broken page. The site now prerenders
  `/404` so a missing path is a real 404, and `deploy.sh` polls every hashed asset (with a
  throwaway query string, so the polling can never poison the canonical cache key) until all of
  them are served, then warms them, before it says the deploy is done.

Cost: no new chunks; the generator page's eager JavaScript moved by well under a kilobyte.

## 8d. Style presets

Added 2026-09-04, the one item from §9 worth doing now that the swatches exist. A "Look" row
leads the Shape group in both control sets: five drawn tiles (Classic, Rounded, Dots, Leaf,
Soft), each the corner of a code with a finder pattern and a patch of data in that look. One tile
sets the module shape and both corner shapes together; in Basic it replaces the Modules row, and
in Advanced the Modules, Corner frames, and Corner dots rows sit under it for adjusting.

A look is matched, not stored (`Design.look` in `state.svelte.ts`, presets in `lib/looks.ts`):
the design keeps its three shapes and the tile they equal is the selected one, so a hand change
in Advanced leaves no tile selected rather than a stale one. Because Basic can now set corner
shapes through a look, `advancedInUse` reports "corner shapes" only for a combination no look
offers. The collapsed summary names the look ("Soft · Logo") and falls back to the old detail
for a custom one. Colours, the logo, and the frame are not part of a look; they are separate
decisions.

## 8e. The crop box

Added 2026-09-04, the second item from §9. The Crop group in Photo QR now leads with the picture
itself, drawn on a square stage of paper with the data area over it as a box: drag the box to
choose what shows in the code, drag its corner to zoom, or use the arrow keys and plus and minus
with the stage focused. The box is the engine's placement run backwards (`lib/crop.ts`, tested
against `imagePlacement` case by case), so what it frames is exactly what the code blends in and
no second model of the crop exists. The Zoom slider stays in both control sets; the Across and
Down sliders moved to Advanced, since the box says the same thing in a picture.

## 9. Out of scope for this refresh

- Dark mode. The paper look is the brand; a dark theme is a separate decision.
- ~~Style presets~~ — built, see §8d.
- ~~A draggable crop box for Photo QR~~ — built, see §8e.
- Any change to the engine, the renderers, the goldens, the exports, or the SignUpCity hand-off.
- New copy for the marketing pages beyond trimming ledes on phones.

## 10. Verification

Automated, every phase: `bun run check`, `bun run test` (no golden updates expected; if a golden
goes red the phase touched something it should not have), `bun run build` with the generator
page's gzipped size noted in the commit message against the 150 KB budget.

In the Browser pane, every phase: 1440 px and 375 px screenshots of Basic and Advanced with the
Style and Photo QR panels open, checked for wrapping, alignment, and layout shift while typing
(measure the preview card's `top` before and after a keystroke, as the notes in memory say).

On hardware, at the end (Garrett): open the generator on the iPhone and an Android, confirm the
preview bar appears when scrolling, download a PNG from the bar, and check the "actual size"
toggle against a printed test sheet. Add a row to `docs/scan-matrix.md` only if an export path
changed, which none should.

## 11. Order and effort

| Phase | Evenings | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 Primitives | 1 | Lands with Phase 1 in the same session; nothing visible on its own. |
| 1 Style panel | 1 to 2 | The priority. Ship this before anything else. |
| 2 Shell, content, phones | 1 to 2 | The preview bar is the only new behaviour. |
| 3 Size and download | 1 | Presentation only. |
| 4 Photo QR | 0.5 | Mostly swapping in the primitives. |
| 5 Other pages, polish | 1 | Can be split across sessions. |

Phases 0 and 1 are one pull request. Each later phase is its own, so a regression is easy to
find. Nothing in a later phase depends on a design decision that Phase 1 does not already make.
