/**
 * The contract between the bulk page and its Web Worker, plus the shapes both sides share.
 *
 * ## How matrices cross the worker boundary
 *
 * A run of 2,000 codes is 2,000 matrices of roughly 33 x 33 booleans. Sent as `boolean[][]`
 * that is two million single-element arrays to structured-clone, which is slow and allocates
 * heavily on both sides. Instead every matrix is packed, row-major, one byte per module
 * (1 = dark, 0 = light), into a **single flat `Uint8Array`** holding all items end to end in
 * item order. Each item carries its own `size` (modules per side); an item's slice therefore
 * starts at the running sum of `size * size` over the items before it, which is what
 * `matrixOffsets` computes. Items that failed to encode have `size: 0` and occupy no bytes.
 *
 * That is one ~2 MB buffer, transferable in both directions, instead of 2,000 nested arrays.
 * `unpackMatrix` turns a slice back into the `boolean[][]` the engine's renderers and
 * `layoutLabels` expect.
 *
 * The worker holds no state between messages: a render request carries the items and the bits
 * back to it. That keeps cancellation honest, because cancelling terminates the worker outright
 * and the page never loses a finished generation run.
